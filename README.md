EventHandler is a simple plugin that allows server Owners/Admins to cancel specific events on their server that may not be supported by other plugins.

I thought of this idea when I came across a few random threads where members where looking to cancel some small events, like entities crushing turtle eggs, tab complete, filling buckets, and so much more.

This plugin currently has a small list of events that you can cancel simply by setting the cancel to true in the config. Ive split it up into 4 main categories, Block Events, Server Events, Entity Events and Player Events. All of the player events have an option to send a message to the player when they attempt said event, as well as bypass permissions. Some of the events will require Paper since their API includes a lot more things.

If you have ideas for more events for me to add, I am all ears. I would like to make this plugin more extensive so bring on those ideas.

Everything is off by default.
